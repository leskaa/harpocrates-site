# About

![alt-text](assets/doc-image.png)

## Inspiration

Inspired, of course, by the hackathon prompt, as well as our desire to make easy-to-use and easy-to-access solutions to common daily problems, we decided to make Harpocrates. Discord is a popular social platform that many people use many times per day. Providing safety measures and tips on a convenient and frequently used platform is a great way to reach our users and remind them of digital privacy!

## How we built it

## Challenges we ran into

ML stuff?
Running ML stuff on the same server -> had to make a microservice :)
Difficulties with Replit?

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Creating complex regex to identify private information that someone may not want to share
Trying many ML things idk

## What we learned

## What's next for Harpocrates

We plan to improve the machine learning model for recognizing addresses in order to more accurately protect your users’ privacy. The address recognition problem is not just difficult for amateurs like us, but also for many businesses. Thus rather than machine learning, many businesses use a large set of all the possible addresses. In the future we may try to choose this approach or go back to making slight improvements to the ML model and using a larger dataset to learn from.

Everyone’s needs are different, so we believe customization is important, especially for a tool that moderates messages. We currently have the ability to enable and disable most features, however we plan to add more customization settings in order to allow custom levels of moderation. 

The tips and resources will be added to, so that daily tips don’t run dry and our resources can become a one-stop shop for users trying to increase their digital privacy and security.

Overall, we hope to add more features and ways to make security accessible through discord, protect your users’ information, increase ease of use, and promote digital privacy and safety awareness!
